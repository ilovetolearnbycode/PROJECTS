### Front end projects

# Start with these projects to gain clarity on concepts:
---------------------------------------------------------

HTML & CSS : 
-----------

* learn HTML5 and know its layout structures
* learn css3 and its hierarchy structure in using it.
* create at least 10 projects using HTML and CSS alone.
* learning flexbox and grid in CSS3 is useful.
* although these projects may not end up in the resume it will surely help to gain confidence in the content and appear in the interviews.

### Projects:
------------
* [ ] make a website to display about the pigeons
* [ ] make a website with a form containing the all form fields [all form fields](https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-choose-the-right-form-field-for-your-forms/)
* [ ] make a fullpage background image slider
* [ ] make a fullpage video background
* [ ] make a gym website (from any inspiration in internet).


VANILLA JS
-----------

* basics is must [freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbk2qRZtWSzCIN38JC_NdhW5)
* object oriented will be helpful
* es5 or es6 versions and its difference must be understood clearly.
* JS algorthims and datastructures [taught by bau from freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkso-IbgiiP48n-O-JQA9PJ)
* JS ES6 latest [dev ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZQc7RUAg18)


### Projects
-------------
* [ ] make a todo app
* [ ] make a timer or javascript clock
* [ ] make a memory game
* [ ] make a color palette generator [inspiration](https://coolors.co/8cb369-f4e285-f4a259-5b8e7d-bc4b51)
* [ ] make a FAQ page

* Road Maps:
---------
* get the basic HTML,CSS  good in the basics upto a level that you are able to understand others code and get the idea of building it.
* get the vanilla js, with its basics , datastructures and algorithms, es6 latest js basics done.
* build the projects as many as you want to get the grip of that topic.
* basic understanding of HTML,CSS and indepth understanding of vanilla js is a must.
* then learn to use client side apis and build some projects with them
* then learn basics of node js and express js mainly there architecture( you can follow freecodecamp for this).
* learn baiscs of firebase and mongo db
* projects with the above all topics is useful and necessary to get the entire idea of working with projects.
* then start with react js
* get the basics ready and firm.
* build basic projects using react js
* then study the state management in react js
* then react native would be useful but only if the basics are clear.
* learn redux 

projects is all about what we learn through and lean through.
we get a lots of experience with learning from projects building and then getting comfortable in the region of working.
